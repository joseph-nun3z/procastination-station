## First Encounter *(After B5g Battle)*
The party first encountered Rahadin immediately after the battle at the Western Barricade. He arrived on an ash-gray phantom steed, flanked by twelve zombies (six on each side).

### The Deathly Choir
An unsettling supernatural effect surrounds Rahadin constantly:
- A 10-foot radius of psychic screams
- Builds from a dull roar to a cacophony of thousands of voices
- The screams recede slightly when he speaks
- Deeply unsettling to witness

### The Proclamation
Rahadin delivered Strahd's formal proclamation to the village:

> *"Five score and seven days past, this people rose in unlawful rebellion against Strahd von Zarovich, Count of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft, and Protector of the Balinok Mountains. For this treasonous act, this settlement has been met with righteous punishment, so that its inhabitants might learn the weight of their defiance.*
>
> *Witnessed by the eyes of the dead and damned, this price has been extracted in blood, common and noble alike. Let it be known that on this day, the mercy of Strahd von Zarovich extends once more unto those who return to their fief and field—while those who continue in their folly shall be swept away as chaff before the wind."*

### Message to Ismark
After reading the proclamation, Rahadin delivered a personal message to Ismark:

> *"Please accept my congratulations on your new position—and my condolences on your loss."*

This revealed to Ismark that his father, the Burgomaster, was dead.

## Observed Behavior
- Shows no emotion or hesitation in his duties
- Speaks as if common people are far beneath his station
- References "the will of Strahd" as absolute law
- Made it clear he was merely a messenger, not there to fight
- Left peacefully after delivering his message

## What the Party Knows
- He is Strahd's chamberlain (court official)
- He has significant power - commands undead and rides a phantom steed
- He can deliver proclamations on Strahd's behalf
- He knew about Kolyan's death before anyone in the village
- The screaming effect around him suggests dark power or a curse
- He considers himself and Strahd to be the party's "betters"
