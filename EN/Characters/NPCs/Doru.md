## Background & History
Doru was the beloved son of the village priest [[EN/Characters/NPCs/Donavich|Donavich]] and grew up as one of Barovia's most promising young men. He was engaged to [[EN/Characters/NPCs/Gertruda|Gertruda]], daughter of Mary, and their wedding was eagerly anticipated by the entire village.

Several months ago, Doru organized what the villagers now call "the failed revolution" - a brave but ultimately doomed attempt to rally the people against the supernatural threats plaguing the land. He convinced several young villagers to join him in a march toward what they believed would be their liberation.

## The Failed Revolution *(Village Account)*
According to survivors and witnesses:
- Doru managed to rally a group of young villagers to his cause
- They marched out with makeshift weapons and righteous determination
- Few returned, and those who did were traumatized and spoke little of what happened
- Doru himself never returned and is presumed to have died in the attempt
- The failure of the revolution has left the village more demoralized than before

## Village Memories *(Local Recollections)*
The villagers share various memories of Doru:

- *"He had such passion for justice, always helping those in need"* - common sentiment
- *"Gertruda and Doru were so happy together, planning their future"* - elder women's memories
- *"He believed we could fight back, make things better"* - admiring but sad recollection
- *"If only he had been more careful, less reckless"* - worried hindsight
- *"His father hasn't been the same since"* - concerned observation
- *"The revolution failed because evil is too strong here"* - defeated conclusion
