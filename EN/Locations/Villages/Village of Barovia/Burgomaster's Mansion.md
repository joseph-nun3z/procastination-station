The mansion has housed the burgomaster's family for generations, serving as both home and seat of governance. The Kolyanovich family has maintained this residence as a symbol of stability and leadership in the village. Recent months have seen the building take on a more fortress-like character as threats to the family have increased.

## Current Situation
The mansion shows clear signs of recent defensive preparations. Heavy furniture has been moved to barricade windows, doors are reinforced and heavily barred, and the family appears to be living in a state of heightened alert. [[EN/Characters/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] has been coordinating these defensive measures while his father remains largely secluded.
